# Cuis-Website

A web site for Cuis Smalltalk.

This is a Jekyll site that uses a template and some instructions for running Github Pages with the [`minima` theme][minima]. 

* Frontpage that includes your last blog posts: `_pages/frontpage.md`
* Archive for all your posts: `_pages/archive.md`
* About page: `_pages/about.md`
* Minimum 404 page: `_pages/404.md`
* Minimum metadata in the `_config.yml`
* Example CSS change inside `assets/main.scss`
* Custom footer template `_includes/footer.html`

Check out the excellent [`minima` theme][minima] documentation for further details and customization and the [official docs][gh] for more details on how Github Pages work.

For more details on how to create content, use Github interface, etc. feel free to browse [the website][web] or the source code here.
