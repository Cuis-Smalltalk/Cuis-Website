For a kick start, read The "Terse Guide" to install directly from the
environment. It is useful both as a guide and a reference (in Cuis
World Menu Help>Terse Guide to Cuis).

Additionally, there are many tutorials and references for Smalltalk in the web. They apply quite well to Cuis, especially those written originally for Smalltalk-80 or Squeak. These books ["Smalltalk-80 the language and its implementation"](http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/FreeBooks/BlueBook/Bluebook.pdf) and ["Inside Smalltalk volume I"](http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/FreeBooks/InsideST/InsideSmalltalk.pdf) are great introductory texts, and they are also the reference for the language and basic class library. Both are freely available. Read other references from [Stef's Free Online Smalltalk Books](http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/FreeBooks/) collection.
