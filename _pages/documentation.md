If you are learning Smalltalk, the Cuis community can help you. Check the ["Learning Cuis Smalltalk"](https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Learning-Cuis "Learning Cuis Smalltalk") repository. It includes several great tutorials. Also, the TerseGuide.pck.st package (in the /Packages folder in this repo) is useful both as a guide and a reference.

Additionally, there are many tutorials and references for Smalltalk in the web. They apply quite well to Cuis, especially those written originally for Smalltalk-80 or Squeak. These books ["Smalltalk-80 the language and its implementation"](http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/FreeBooks/BlueBook/Bluebook.pdf) and ["Inside Smalltalk volume I"](http://stephane.ducasse.free.fr/FreeBooks/InsideST/InsideSmalltalk.pdf) are great introductory texts, and they are also the reference for the language and basic class library. Both are freely available.

The user interface enables you to access most of the code and conduct Smalltalk experiments on your own. You can review its features at ["Quick Tour of the UI"](https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Learning-Cuis/blob/master/Quick-UI-Tour.md).
