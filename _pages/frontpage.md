Cuis is a free Smalltalk-80 environment with a specific set of goals: being simple and powerful. It is also portable to any platform, fast and efficient.

<p class="legend">A typical work-in-progress scene in Cuis-Smalltalk
application development: An Inspector displays an object from the
running application, a message is sent to this object to show its
halo, and the auto-completion tool is active. Class browsers are open
on the application’s relevant classes; a Transcript provides feedback
on the application’s execution; under the application view, a
Workspace contains code related to the application.</p>
