    <h3>Satellite Image and Signal Processing</h3>
    <img src="./assets/imgs/story_satellogic.jpg" class="doc" style="width:300px;">
    <p align="justify">Satellogic implemented a model to simulate the
      non-ideal behavior of image sensors and optical systems,
      including motion blur. It includes raw images processing with
      deblur, coded exposure, automatic registration, resampling and
      HDR.  Image compression, transmission over an unreliable low
      bitrate link, and decoding were also implemented. A dedicated
      decoder for radio signals (SDR) was implemented too. Cuis
      Smalltalk proved to be an agile and flexible environment for
      these tasks, enabling both quick experiments and their growth
      into useful frameworks and applications.</p>

    <h3>Cuis-University</h3>
    <img src="./assets/imgs/story_cuis-university.jpg" class="doc" style="width:300px;">
    <p align="justify">A variant of Cuis, called Cuis-University, is
    used in a course teaching object-oriented programming at the
    Computer Science Department of several universities in Argentina
    (Universidad de Buenos Aires, Universidad Nacional de Quilmes,
    Universidad Catolica Argentina).</p>

    <h3>GNU Dr. Geo</h3>
    <img src="./assets/imgs/story_drgeo.jpg" class="doc" style="width:300px;">
    <p align="justify">Dr. Geo aims to be an open, easy to study,
      modify and extend interactive geometry software. It is
      distributed with its source code. You can modify its own source
      code while using it. Ten years old kids use Dr. Geo to explore
      Euclidean geometric sketches; agile kids extend and program it
      with its embedded dynamic Smalltalk language and user
      interface. It is used in junior high school in Geneva to teach
      both mathematics and programming with its dedicated Euclidean
      geometry specific language in Smalltalk.</p>
