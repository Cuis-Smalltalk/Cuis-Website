    <h3>Satellite Image and Signal Processing</h3>
    <img src="./assets/imgs/story_satellogic.jpg" class="doc" style="width:300px;">
    <p align="justify">Satellogic implemented a model to simulate the
      non-ideal behavior of image sensors and optical systems,
      including motion blur. It includes raw images processing with
      deblur, coded exposure, automatic registration, resampling and
      HDR.  Image compression, transmission over an unreliable low
      bitrate link, and decoding were also implemented. A dedicated
      decoder for radio signals (SDR) was implemented too. Cuis
      Smalltalk proved to be an agile and flexible environment for
      these tasks, enabling both quick experiments and their growth
      into useful frameworks and applications.
