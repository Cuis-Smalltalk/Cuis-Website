Cuis is:

- Small and Clean,
- Free Software,
- Multi-platform.
 
Like any Smalltalk systems, it is also:

- A complete development environment written in itself,
- A pure, dynamic Object Oriented language.

Cuis assumes very little on the underlying platform, and this lets it run out-of-the-box on Windows, MacOS, Linux, ChromeOS and WebBrowsers. Cuis shares the [OpenSmalltalk Virtual Machine](http://www.opensmalltalk.org) with [Squeak](http://squeak.org), [Pharo](http://pharo.org) and [Newspeak](http://newspeaklanguage.org).

What sets Cuis apart from the other members of the Squeak family is the focus on Smalltalk-80 and an active attitude towards system complexity:

Unbound complexity growth, together with development strategies focused only in the short term, are the worst long term enemies of all software systems. As systems grow older, they usually become more complex. New features are added as layers on top of whatever is below, sometimes without really understanding it, and almost always without modifying it. Complexity and size grow without control. Evolution slows down. Understanding the system becomes harder every day. Bugs are harder to fix. Codebases become huge for no clear reason. At some point, the system can't evolve anymore and becomes "legacy code".

Complexity puts a limit to the level of understanding of the system a person might reach, and therefore limits the things that can be done with it. Dan Ingalls says all this in ["Design Principles Behind Smalltalk"](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/cs655/readings/smalltalk.html). Even if you have already done so, please go and read it again!

Cuis Smalltalk is our attempt at this challenge. Furthermore, we believe we are doing something else that no other Smalltalk, commercial or open source, does. We attempt to give the true Smalltalk-80 experience, and keep Smalltalk-80 not as legacy software of historic significance, but as a live, evolving system. We feel we are the keepers of the Smalltalk-80 heritage, and enablers of the Dynabook experience.

As Cuis evolves, we keep on these values. Every update, be it a bug fix or a feature enhancement, is reviewed carefully to avoid adding unneded complexity to the system. Every opportunity to remove unneded complexity is followed. As we go, features are enhanced, and any reported bugs fixed. We also adopt selected enhancements from Squeak and Pharo, and share our work with the wider Smalltalk community.
