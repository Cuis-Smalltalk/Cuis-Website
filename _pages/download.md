# Quick Start

The easy way to get a glimpse of Cuis: Get with one of the Cuis-University bundles. Cuis-University is a special distribution of Cuis maintained by prof. Hernan Wilkinson, used at courses on Programming and Software Engineering in several universities. These bundles are easy to install for GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.

Please note that this is not the main Cuis distribution, and can't be updated as Cuis evolves. If you prefer to install by yourself your programming environment, jump to the next section and follow the instructions.
