# Quick Start

The easiest way to set up Cuis in your system is the the latest [Cuis Stable Release](https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Cuis7-0).



# Latest Developments

If you want to enjoy the latest enhancements to Cuis, report bugs, or contribute back to the project, you will install the Cuis-Smalltalk code repositories and an appropriate VM for your system.

To do so, use the [Cuis Rolling Release](https://github.com/Cuis-Smalltalk/Cuis-Smalltalk-Dev).



# Removing Cuis from your system

The installation procedures above don't modify your system. If later you want to remove Cuis from your computer, just remove the Cuis folder you created. That's all.
