special versions of Cuis to teach programming at the university. These
bundles are easy to install for GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and Windows.  If

# Installation for the braves

In case you want to use Cuis with another system or you want to enjoy
its latest enhancements, you will install <em>by hand</em> all its
consisting parts: the source code repository, the latest image and the
appropriate virtual machine for your system.

To do so, <a
